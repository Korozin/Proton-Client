  <p>Proton Client is a simple mod injector for Minecraft: Wii U Edition. I've made one in the past, but that was when I first started coding; so the internals were written <i>horribly</i>. So this aims to be a simpler, cleaner, and more powerful tool than what I've made previously.</p>

  <h1>NOTE!</h1>
  <p>This tool is still under construction. I haven't fully decided what all I want to add to it. That being said, I am open to feature requests. Everything currently implemented should work fine though.</p>
